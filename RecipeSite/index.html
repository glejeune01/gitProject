    <a href=".\RecipeOne\RecipeOne.html"><div class="recipeTitle">Vanilla Cake</div></a>
    <div class="recipeDescription">Sink your teeth into this delicious vanilla based fruit laden cake. Don't have a lot of experience? No problem, by a cake mix in your local food market and throw it in the oven. Grab some vanilla icing, and some fresh fruit and your on your way to impressing your neighbors! </div>

    <a href=".\RecipeTwo\RecipeTwo.html"><div class="recipeTitle">Margarita Pizza</div></a>
    <div class="recipeDescription">We'd recommend throwing this special pie onto your pizza stone. Turn your oven on the most scalding option you have, and heat the stone for minimally 20 minutes. As that's prepping, use the dough from your market, add tomatoes and mozza cheeze. Throw some basil on there and you've got yourself a party.</div>

    <a href=".\RecipeThree\RecipeThree.html"><div class="recipeTitle">Rainbow Bowl</div></a>
    <div class="recipeDescription">Are you into eating health? Yeah me neither. Anyways - get your vegetables in at least a colourful way that may make you feel better until you buy your next pizza. Works with any leftover meats and we recommend using avocado and lentils to super pack this dish with nutriants.</div>

    <a href=".\RecipeFour\RecipeFour.html"><div class="recipeTitle">Dessert Platter</div></a>
    <div class="recipeDescription">Let's be honest. You're not making this. Go to sobeys and pick up packaged desserts, open them up at the same time, put them on your fancy dishes and you're all set. If you want to get super fancy, let your grandmother know you're planning a party and I'm sure she has squares in her fridge.</div>

    <a href=".\RecipeFive\RecipeFive.html"><div class="recipeTitle">Pancakes</div></a>
    <div class="recipeDescription">Like a true North American, why not have cake for breakfast? This is what the ex-queen of France was talking about. This recipe takes it even further by melting biscoff or offbrand cookie butter and drizzling it all over. Pairs nicely with a trip to the hospital to unclog the veins.</div>

    <a href=".\RecipeSix\RecipeSix.html"><div class="recipeTitle">Breakfast Platter</div></a>
    <div class="recipeDescription">It's breakfast. Pretty straight forward stuff. Crack an egg, gut a grapefruit, and slather them pancakes (maybe using one of our other recipes!). Bacon brings it all together. To be enjoyed with the morning paper or a good book!</div>
